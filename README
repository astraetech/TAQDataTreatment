TAQ Data Treatment

TAQ Database contains intradaily trading and quoting records. The
trading volume has greatly increased due to the electronic communication
network. Users can use SAS to directly fetch the dataset. When using
the TAQ website to request and download files from TAQ, they usually
have large sizes and are difficult to work on.
This project uses shell script (mainly awk) and Rscript to seperate the
large files into small data files (R data files) according to each stock
and trading date. Some preliminary data treatment are also included to
filter out faulty records.
The files and scripts are described in the following.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

dj30.txt
It contains a list of symbols of DJ30 stocks (in 2012). It is used to
obtain DJ30 stocks' intradaily records in TAQ database.

dj30_name.csv
It contains the symbols, names, and stock exchanges of the DJ30 stocks.

halfdays.txt
It contains half trading days from 1993 to 2012. The format is numeric:
yyyymmdd.

TAQSplit2RData.sh
TAQcsv2RData.R
TAQSplit2gz.sh
SortRData.sh
They are the scripts to seperate large files into either RData files or
compressed csv files. The small files are in the same directory as the
large file. Then the files can be sorted into sub-directories according
to stocks. For each large file the script creates an index file with
the line numbers of each stock/date.

TAQExtract.sh
TAQExtract.R
Given a symbol and a date, the script find the records from the large
data file. If an index file exists, it utilizes the information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

TAQFilter.R
An R function that takes the data frame or the path to the RData file as
input and returns a logical vector whose TRUE implies a normal record
and FALSE implies a faulty record.

TAQError.R
An R function that takes the data frame or the path to the RData file as
input and returns a logical vector which has FALSE on the prices that
yield obsurd returns (those may be caused by mislocated decimal point).

TAQOutLiersBHLS.R
An R function that takes a vector of prices and returns a logical vector
which has TRUE on the possible outliers.

TAQSparseSample.R
An R function that takes the data frame and returns a sparsed sampled
data frame with only time and price columns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

TAQCondPlot.R
An R function that takes the data frame or the path to the RData file as
input and plot a graph which highlights the abnormal points.
