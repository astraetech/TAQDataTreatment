TAQ Data Treatment

TAQ Database contains intradaily trading and quoting records. The
trading volume has greatly increased due to the electronic communication
network. Users can use SAS to directly fetch the dataset from TAQ.
When requesting and downloading data directly from TAQ website, the
files are usually huge and difficult to work with.
This project uses shell script (mainly awk) and Rscript to seperate the
large files into small data files (R data files) according to each stock
and each date. Some preliminary data treatment are also included such as
faulty records filter.

The files and scripts are described in the following, categorized by
their functions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) General Information

    dj30.txt
  It contains a list of symbols of DJ30 stocks (as in 2012). It is used
  in the symbol field when pulling data from TAQ database. 

    dj30_name.csv
  It contains the symbols, names, and exchanges of the DJ30 stocks.

    halfdays.txt
  It contains a list of half trading days from 1993 to 2012. The format
  is yyyymmdd.

    Overview of TAQ Data.pdf
  As titled.

(2) Split Huge Data Files

    TAQSplit2gz.sh
  Split TAQ data file (csv, gz, or zip) into small pieces according to
  stocks and dates, that is each file contains information of one stock
  and one day.
  
    TAQSplit2RData.sh
  The core of this project. Similar as above, while it further converts
  csv files into RData files. It depends on the following R script (and
  R program).

    TAQcsv2RData.R
  Read a csv file into R and export into an RData file. The column types
  are explicitly specified.

    SortRData.sh
  If the large raw data file contains many stocks and many dates, the
  splitting process will generate a large amount of smaller files. This
  script sort those files into sub-directories by stock symbols.

    TAQLoop.sh
  Loop through all symbols and dates for a large file then create an
  index file or run a script if provided on a small csv file for each
  symbol/date combination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Retrieve Records of One Stock/Date Pair

    TAQExtract.sh
  Given a symbol and a date, the script find the records from the large
  data file. If an index file exists, it utilizes the information. It
  may take a few minutes depending on where the records locate in the
  large file.

    TAQExtract.R
  A wrapper of above shell script in R.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Basic Filters for Bad Records

    TAQFilter.R
  An R function that takes the data frame or the path to the RData file
  as input and returns a logical vector with the same length as the row
  number of the data frame, where TRUE implies a normal record and FALSE
  implies a faulty record.

    TAQError.R
  An R function that takes the data frame or the path to the RData file
  as input and returns a logical vector with the same length as the row
  number of the data frame, where FALSE implies an obsurd price (which
  may be caused by mislocated decimal point for example).

    TAQOutLiersBHLS.R
  An R function that takes a vector of prices and returns a logical
  vector with the same length as the row number of the data frame, where
  TRUE implies a possible outlier.

    TAQSparseSample.R
  An R function that takes the stock data frame and returns a data frame
  with the row numbers of the original data frame for each desired time
  stamp.

    TAQCondPlot.R
  An R function that takes the data frame or the path to the RData file
  as input and plot a graph which highlights the abnormal points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Create Working Samples

    TAQApplyFilter.R
  An R function that takes the path of an RData, checks formats of each
  column, updates the RData if necessary, applies selected filters and
  saved them in a filter file (RData format).

    TAQCreateSamples.R
  Similar as above, but with more filters applied. And it will report
  error rather than update original file if the formats checking doesn't
  go through.

    TAQCheckData.R
  An R script that creates a data frame of metadata of small RData files
  and fills out the data frame if filter files have been created.
